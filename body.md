2020 Lutz Lake Fern Kingdom Hall Renovation Project

Hello Friends,

As the construction project fast approaches, I'd like to take the opportunity to invite you to assist us on this date. See attached for a letter for details on the project itself. We ask that you also sign the second page of the attached DC-82 form, and Bring It With You.

We will be calling those who I don't hear from, to ensure that everyone got the invitation.

Your willingness to offer yourselves up brings honor to Jehovah (Judges 5:2). I look forward to working with you all this year, and far into the future as the New World draws near.

Thank you!
